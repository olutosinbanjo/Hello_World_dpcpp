## What is DPC++ ?

DPC++ is a project under Intel® oneAPI; it is Intel’s adaption / implementation of SYCL - an industry-driven standard that adds data parallelism to C++ for heterogeneous systems. It is a friendly relationship between C++, SYCL and added extensions (- such as Unified Shared Memory, use of sub-groups, e.t.c).

Therefore, learning DPC++ is simply learning ”data-parallel programming with C++, SYCL and some new extensions for - homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures - CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, other accelerators, CPU-GPU, CPU-GPU-FPGA, CPU-FPGA”. What does DPC++ bring to the table - 

:heavy_check_mark: Accelerated Computing

:heavy_check_mark: Heterogeneous Computing

:heavy_check_mark: Open Specification

:heavy_check_mark: Cross-industry

:heavy_check_mark: Cross-architecture

:heavy_check_mark: Unified Programming Model - Singular code base for host and device codes

:heavy_check_mark: Data centric paradigm
